# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-Model
<br>
> Objective: Develop an AI-based model to classify underwater objects as either rocks or mines.
 <br>
> Motivation: Traditional sonar analysis is manual, slow, and error-prone.
 <br>
> Solution: Use machine learning to analyze sonar signal data and automate classification.
 <br>
> Benefits:
     Faster and more accurate predictions
     <br>
     Reduces human error and operational risks
     <br>
     Useful in defense, marine research, and autonomous systems
     <br>
> Outcome: A reliable, scalable tool for real-time underwater object detection.
