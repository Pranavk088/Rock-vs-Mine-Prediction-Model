# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-Model
> Objective: Develop an AI-based model to classify underwater objects as either rocks or mines.
> Motivation: Traditional sonar analysis is manual, slow, and error-prone.
> Solution: Use machine learning to analyze sonar signal data and automate classification.
> Benefits:
     Faster and more accurate predictions
     Reduces human error and operational risks
     Useful in defense, marine research, and autonomous systems
> Outcome: A reliable, scalable tool for real-time underwater object detection.
